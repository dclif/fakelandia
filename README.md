# Justice for Fakelandia

## Introduction

This project is for the purpose of practicing the following:
* Writing tests for your components
* Using BEM to write scalable, reusable CSS
* Keeping your components small and refactoring them into sub-components where necessary
* Using hooks to store state, make API calls, and pass data down to sub-components through contexts

## Crimes and Misdemeanours

The Fakelandians have asked for a site that lets them browse lists of crimes committed today, and also for functionality that helps citizens confess to their own crimes. 

As a non-citizen, you might not be aware that there are only four possible crimes in Fakelandia:

* Mild Public Rudeness
* Speaking in a Lift
* Not Eating Your Vegetables
* Supporting Manchester United

Despite the clear severity of some of these awful crimes, the Fakelandians refer to them all as "misdemeanours".

To run and test the application:

npm start & npm test
```

You should then be able to access the default application by opening the browser and visiting

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
